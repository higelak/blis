# blis
Simple arithmetic calculator.

My main programming language is C ++. Some time ago, in my free time, I began to study Rust, spent about ten hours in total on reading the manual. I learned about 50%. Then I decided to write my first Rust project. This is simple arithmetic calculator. I named him blis. Don't ask why blis. I have a constant problem with project names :) Just let it be. Someday I will tell you how this name came to my mind. As my knowledge of Rust increases, I will improve this project.
