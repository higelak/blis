Simple arithmetic calculator.

## Description
My first Rust project. My main programming language is C ++. Some time ago, in my free time, I began to study Rust, spent about ten hours in total on reading the manual. I learned about 50%. Then I decided to write something. 
Calculator. Why not? I named him "blis". Don't ask why "blis". Someday I will tell you how this name came to my mind. As my knowledge of Rust increases, I will improve this project. May be :)
